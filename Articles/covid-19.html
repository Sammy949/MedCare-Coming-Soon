			    		<span>COVID-19</span> originated in the city of Wuhan in the Hubei province of China, it has spread rapidly across the world, resulting in a human tragedy and tremendous economic damage. By mid-June, there had been over 8 million cases of COVID-19 globally, with over 436,000 deaths.<br>

			    		<span>The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19)</span> was first reported in <span>China</span> as an infectious upper respiratory disease. The virus has since spread worldwide presenting one of the most serious global health crises in history, with high socio-economic costs. While the health impacts are directly through contagion, the economic impacts are largely a consequence of the preventive measures adopted by the respective governments to curtail its spread. Key measures adopted by most countries to curtail the spread include the closing of their frontiers and partial or complete lockdowns of economies which among other things, have seen the temporary closure of businesses, schools and social services.<br>

			    		The Coronavirus began in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Residents who lived in Wuhan had some link to a large seafood and live animal market, which suggest that the mode of transmission of coronavirus was from animal to person. The virus has been named SARS-CoV-2 and the disease it causes has been named coronavirus disease 2019 abbreviated Covid-19. The first known patient of Coronavirus started experiencing symptoms in Wuhan, China on 1 December 2019. Since then, there have been over 800,000 reported cases around the world. The U.S. had the largest reported cases, followed by Spain and Russia. In Africa, South Africa had the largest reported cases, followed by Egypt and Nigeria.<br>
			    		The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air, and quickly fall on floors or surfaces.<br>
			    		You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within close proximity of someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth.
